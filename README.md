# Tax-Calculator
1. "index.html" : Contains the HTML layout code.
2. "style.css" : Contains the styling code for the website.
3. "practice.js" : Contains the main functionality of various elements used.

Assumptions made:
1. The final result displayed is:
     Final Income after tax reduction.
2. The total applicable deductions can be greater than the gross annual income and extra income. Hence the final income could be negative also.
3. The website needs to be refreshed again to calculate new tax record.
4. On clicking the help button, the description of the field pops up, Which goes only when the help button is clicked again.
5. On bringing the cursor over error icon (shown as a circle with !), the error will be displayed for that input field, which will disappear once the cursor is moved out.
6. After correcting the input field, the user needs to click on the submit button again to get rid of error icons.
